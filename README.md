# hypernovelty.x
This website is built with Next.js, The React Framework for Production.

## Getting started
Ah, here we go again.

- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn`
- Take S2 program
- Does yarn install still running? If yes, take PhD program
- If not, `run yarn dev`

Anyone here still using `npm` over `yarn`?

## Production Environment
This site is should be _statically generated_ so you need to run `yarn export` than `yarn build`. Also, this site probably will be deployed to Netflify. Or Vecel? Or Docker? Or to my kubernetes clusters? Who knows?

## License
MIT. Why not.
